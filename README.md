# ComputerSetup Application
This is a program for systems administrators to aid in setup proceedures for computers.

## Background
My work department uses a fair amount third party multi-network software that must be set up in a specific order.
The setup includes adding routes, odbc connections, links to the public desktop, and more.  Each of which must be done on every new computer.
I finally got tired of doing all of these tasks manually, and a command line install script wasn't going to do the job since different users
get different options, laptops are different than desktops, etc.

I hope that others can get as much use out of this little applicaiton as I have.

## Requirements
This application requires .NET 4.5.1. Most computers running Windows 7 or later will have this already installed.
If not you can download it from [Microsoft's .NET 4.5.1 Page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40779).
You are welcome to change the target version of .NET yourself if you download the source code and open it in Visual Studio.

## Instructions
Coming soon!
